				<p>One of our objectives is the long-term preservation and facilitation of public access to all forms of printed materials in all Indian languages and English. India having been the largest producer of printed materials in the form of books, journals, periodicals and newspapers, particularly in the early 19th century, the need of the hour is to locate and preserve this historical legacy.</p>
				<p>The SPINAC has its own in-house new Digitization technologies and electronic resources that help libraries, institutions and individuals in archival quality digitization and preservation. The SPINAC can handle wide varieties of media â€“ printed books and journals, paintings, audio and video recordings and the performing arts. We store everything on durable media that is both easy to access, but at the same time have a very low deterioration rate.</p>
